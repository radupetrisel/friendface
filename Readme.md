This is challenge #4 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/5/3/challenge)). This app is a technique project for downloading and parsing data from the internet.

As this is a challenge project, there will be no other challenges at the end.
